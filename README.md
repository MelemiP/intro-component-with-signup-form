## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This project was my best mobile-first approach yet and also the most responsive across all screen sizes without adding separate breakpoints for tablet. I intend to apply this to future projects, and see if I can use some techniques from this project in older ones that need more responsive designs.  


### Continued development

After some feedback from the community, I'd like to get the RegEx working to perfect the JS on this project.

### Useful resources

- [JS Form Validation](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-form-validation/) - This helped with alternate ways to craft client side validation forms.
